[QUOTE=Gotty;75430]What would you like to say, tansy?[/QUOTE]
Let me elaborate on that.

As above... the answer is in you question.

[QUOTE=Gotty;75430]If you don't agree with that, you'll need to state your counter argument. [/QUOTE]
I thought I gave a lot of argument in somewhat extensive [URL=https://encode.su/threads/3753-QOI-(Quite-OK-Image-format)-lossless-image-compression-to-PNG-size?p=75303&viewfull=1#post75303]tests[/URL] I did.
Maybe I was wrong and just assumed that it was read. So let me summarise my discoveries:
It's simple and fast, and it excels with what I called [URL=https://encode.su/threads/3753-QOI-(Quite-OK-Image-format)-lossless-image-compression-to-PNG-size?p=75282&viewfull=1#post75282]"typical pg image"[/URL], which is easily compressible, cartoon-like image. It's also (further) compressible by bit encoding (gzip, brotli), not so much by byte encoding (lz4, lizard). Whats more important this encoding is so much faster as it has greatly reduced size of data. In my example qoi+gzip was still 3 times faster than just gzip, which is part of png.
Reason I mention gzip is that it i an integral part of every browser and web server, today and many years back, so it's only logical to utilise it, already available tool, here.

I also noticed that it doesn't do very well with photographic images and stated that. And again due to its speed it would be perfectly fine to test it first and if .qoi is not performing well with this particular image, to switch to default on the fly without noticing the difference.

That's my technical standpoint.
What is yours, other than (expert) opinion?
